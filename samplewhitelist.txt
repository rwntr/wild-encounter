#brief formatting guide
#species with no forms should be uncommented
#additional alola/galar forms should be formatted as comments, like so:
#species region
#no empty lines, leave a # in front of any empty lines
#you can weight how often you get certain species by listing their BASE FORM multiple times.
#you cannot yet weight different forms, do not attempt to do this, it WILL break stuff.
#the following is a very simple example where a meowth is 3x as likely to show up.
#all forms are equally weighted.
#
#
meowth
meowth
meowth
#meowth galar
#meowth alola
#
ponyta
#ponyta galar
#
vulpix
#vulpix alola
