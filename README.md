# wild-encounter
short, kinda scuffed bash script to simulate pokemon wild encounters from a whitelist and print them to terminal using pokego (could be very easily adapted by changing like 5 lines to work with the original pokemon-colorscripts or the rust version floating around)


todo- fix the whole formswitch thing, make it so that formatting on the whitelist is less Bad, hopefully grab forms from pokego -list itself instead of grepping for them in the whitelist, i just need to write a bit in here to funnel the command's output into something readable and workable
